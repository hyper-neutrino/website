                    I skipped this reflection last election, but for this election, I would like to bring this back as I believe it&prime;s a valuable
                    reflection, both for myself and to give voters the ability to make a more informed decision.

                </h1>
                <p className="text-lg">Last term, my priorities were to focus on two key improvements:</p>
                <ol className="pl-8 list-decimal">
                    <li>Deformalize observer communications.</li>
                    <li> Be more direct and isolate what is important to address.</li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Since last election, few official statements have been given. Of them, they were mostly just technical or information.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Overall, I believe that the above two points have been accomplished this term, though there have been fewer opportunities to demonstrate
                    change compared to previous terms.

                    <u>Retrospective (Wave 19)</u>
                </h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    As I skipped this retrospective during the Wave 23 Election, I would like to dedicate some time to reflecting on my third term (Wave 19
                    &ndash; Wave 23) as well.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">Summary</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    My summary from my Wave 19 statement stated that my priorities were establishing an environment where everyone feels safe communicating
                    openly, establishing clear and rigorous protocols, and maintaining transparency. I believe that these have been accomplished; although there
                    is still sometimes tension, that is unavoidable.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Our protocols have continued to improve and I have pushed for and implemented many changes, both from my own proposals and by supporting
                    others&prime; in changing things around the network.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Finally, I believe the observer team has continued to be sufficiently transparent. Fewer things have happened in the past year requiring
                    transparency, but when needed, the team has been upheld this.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">Campaign Promises</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    My campaign promises were to establish more rigorous rules and rewrite the TCN website. In previous terms, I worked to make the constitution
                    more accessible. In the past year, I revised the rules and guidelines back into the constitution, better reflecting its purpose and
                    reintroducing rigor without sacrificing clarity.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Additionally, I completed a rewrite of the entire system, which comes with many technical and developer experience improvements, but most
                    importantly now hosts our new constitution and many other guides and public information pages.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">What to Expect</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    During my Wave 19 statement, I said that if I were re-elected, you could expect me to maintain the stable and calm position that the network
                    was in at the time and make small improvements in several areas. The network has been less stable in the past year than at the time of this
                    statement, but I believe that has mostly been due to external factors and that the team has done its best to control it when it happens.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    I also promised to be a leader who would take ownership of controlling conflicts and take accountability for and implement improvements to
                    any individual, observer, or council mistakes. I believe that I have accepted responsibility wherever applicable for anything the observer
                    team could have done better.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h1 className="text-4xl">Concluding Words</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    The past year and term have not been without its struggles, but I believe that I have delivered on my promises and identified areas for
                    continued improvement.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    I believe that deformalizing observer communications has been successful in improving relations in both directions between the observer team
                    and the rest of the council, and I will continue to uphold this principle and maintain more open, direct, and human communication.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    This term, I will aim to implement a more solid feedback loop, as I believe the network is not currently struggling with any specific issues
                    that need priority on fixing. As such, I will look proactively for areas that may be improved and revisit our policies and procedures and
                    identify how we can make the network better for everyone.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    If I am re-elected, you can expect that I will continue taking personal responsibility for upholding the network&prime;s values and ensuring
                    the observer team does the absolute best possible to serve the council and the network&prime;s interests.
