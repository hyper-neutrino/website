                    I skipped this reflection last election in favor of deformalizing communications to establish a more human tone and address the perception
                    of observers as an indifferent unit or organization, but for this election, I would like to bring this back as I believe it&prime;s a
                    valuable reflection, both for myself to look back on my effectiveness over the last term and for voters to evaluate whether they really want
                    me to continue as an observer.

                    <u>Retrospective (Wave 23)</u>
                </h1>
                <p className="text-lg">Last term, my priorities were to focus on two key improvements:</p>
                <ol className="pl-8 list-decimal">
                    <li>
                        <b>Deformalize observer communications.</b> Specifically, I stated that the way in which statements used to be conducted was tiring for
                        myself and made communication with the observer team uncomfortable, so I would try to make talking to observers feel more like speaking
                        to humans instead of a corporate entity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Be more direct and isolate what is important to address.</b> Tying into the first point as well, previously I engineered my wording
                        pretty cautiously to avoid drama, which in turn made things sometimes confusing or further appear corporate. I stated that I would work
                        on communicating more openly and directly (which additionally would hopefully incentivize others to do the same) and filter things that
                        weren&prime;t really important from statements, cutting context in favor of readability.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Since last election, few official statements have been given. Of them, none of them really contributed to tensions as they were all
                    technical or just information about upcoming events or disclosures.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Overall, I believe that the above two points have been accomplished this term, though there have been fewer opportunities to demonstrate
                    change compared to previous terms. For example, I have been communicating more as just myself without feedback from the team (which has been
                    explicitly disclosed), seeking to speak less formally, and although I have not surveyed anyone regarding this matter, it seems that
                    communication with observers is more open now and we have not received more feedback about difficulty communicating with us.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-4xl">
                    <u>Retrospective (Wave 19)</u>
                </h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    As I skipped this retrospective during the Wave 23 Election, I would like to dedicate some time to reflecting on my third term (Wave 19
                    &ndash; Wave 23) as well.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">Summary</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    My summary from my Wave 19 statement stated that my priorities were (1) establishing an environment where everyone feels comfortable and
                    safe communicating openly, (2) establishing clear and rigorous protocols, and (3) maintaining transparency. I believe that these have been
                    accomplished &mdash; although we still struggle with some tensions in communication, that is unavoidable when stakes are high and in the
                    interest of protecting open communication, we cannot stop people from engaging in what may not necessarily always be good faith.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Our protocols have continued to improve and I have pushed for and implemented many changes, both from my own proposals (such as formalizing
                    the banshare policy to improve our quality control and overhauling the constitution to improve its rigor without sacrificing clarity) and by
                    supporting others&prime; in changing things around the network (such as the tie-breaker proposal for induction votes and the formalization
                    of the observation report feedback cycle).
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Finally, I believe the observer team has continued to be sufficiently transparent. Comparatively fewer things have happened in the past year
                    where this has been applicable, but we were transparent during incidents such as regarding internal team conflicts, the unexpected transfer
                    of network assets to me from Leaf, etc.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">Campaign Promises</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    My campaign promises were to establish more rigorous rules and rewrite the TCN website to serve purposes such as better structured rules,
                    accessible guides, and public information/FAQ pages. In previous terms, I worked to make the constitution more clear and accessible compared
                    to its original form, which was often confusing due to its legal-like wording. In the past year, I revised the rules and guidelines back
                    into the constitution, reflecting its purpose not as server rules but as a document for the entire network itself, establishing and
                    reintroducing its rigor while maintaining readable wording and formatting.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Additionally, I completed a rewrite of the entire website and all other assets (including the global chat relay and voting system) following
                    Leaf&prime;s departure, which comes with many technical and developer experience improvements, but importantly now hosts our new
                    constitution and many other guidelines, onboarding guides for new servers and observers, and public FAQ pages for those looking to research
                    the network.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl">What to Expect</h2>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    During my Wave 19 statement, I said that if I were re-elected, the council could expect me to seek to maintain the stable and calm position
                    that the network was in at the time and make small improvements in several areas. The network has been less stable in the past year than at
                    the time of this statement, but a large amount of that was caused by trying to maintain peace and control conflicts before they caused
                    catastrophic damage, and I believe that the observer team was overall successful in minimizing destabilization.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    I also promised to be a leader who would take ownership of controlling conflicts and take accountability for and implement improvements to
                    any individual, observer, or council mistakes. I believe that I have accepted responsibility wherever applicable for anything the observer
                    team could have done better, and in the past year, I have established a postmortem process to ensure mistakes aren&prime;t made twice and
                    taken personal accountability for improving observer-council relations.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h1 className="text-4xl">Concluding Words</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    The past year and term have not been without its struggles, but I believe that I have delivered on my promises and identified areas for
                    continued improvement.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    I believe that deformalizing observer communications has been successful in improving relations in both directions between the observer team
                    and the rest of the council, and I will continue to uphold this principle and maintain more open, direct, and human communication.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    This term, I will aim to implement a more solid feedback loop, as I believe the network is not currently struggling with any specific issues
                    that need priority on fixing. As such, I will strive to look proactively for areas that may be improved even if they are not failing at the
                    moment and seek to constantly revisit our policies and procedures and identify how we can make the network better for its servers and the
                    environment better for the council.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    If I am re-elected, you can expect that I will continue taking personal responsibility for upholding the network&prime;s values and ensuring
                    the observer team does the absolute best possible to serve the council and the network&prime;s interests.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Here are two concrete ideas I plan to explore (though not all of these will necesarily come into existence, as these will only be
                    implemented if the council believes it would be useful):
                </p>
                <ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
                    <li>
                        <b>Implement a monthly feedback survey.</b>
                        <ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
                            <li>
                                We most often receive feedback when things go wrong, but that often leads to high tension or issues not being communicated in a
                                broader scope.
                            </li>
                            <li>It also means that we don&prime;t know what we are doing right that we should continue doing.</li>
                            <li>
                                As such, I believe a monthly (or some other period) anonymous and optional survey can be helpful to figure out what we should
                                maintain, what we can change before any incidents arise, and any general suggestions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Create a monthly observer summary statement.</b>
                        <ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
                            <li>
                                We removed the weekly summary as there was not enough activity to justify it and we would return the summaries channel to its
                                previous purpose.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To offer more transparency and give more opportunity to feedback, I think it would make sense to give a monthly
                                &quot;report&quot; of sorts, giving some insight into what the observer team is working on, progress on any proposals or
                                suggestions, and how we are addressing any concerns raised.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This both offers transparency to the council and gives the observer team an opportunity to regularly reflect, re-center, and
                                adjust our priorities and make sure nothing is being forgotten or delayed excessively.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
